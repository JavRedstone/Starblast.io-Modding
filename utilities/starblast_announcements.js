// Announcements in Starblast Revamped

/*
  Alright, for those who know what "ship.instructorSays()" is, this is simply
  a nice revamp of that one. It is announcements:
  
  lets say "ship" here is a ship object of the game.ships array:
  
    ship.custom.announce("Hello");
  
  ^ This will announce "Hello" to the specified ship, with the icon of a Loudspeaker
  
    ship.custom.announce("Hello", 1);
  
  ^ This does the same thing
  
    ship.custom.announce("Hello", 2);
  
  ^ This will announce "Hello" to the specified ship, with the icon of a Speaker instead
  
    ship.custom.hide_announcement();
  
  ^ This will hide the announcement from the specified ship
  
    ship.custom.announcements;
  
  ^ To access the list of announcements provided to each ship
  
  Enjoy announcing!
