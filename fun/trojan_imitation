// Trojan Imitation

/*
  Trojan viruses typically impose flashing and screen-covering elements, disposed
  of bright colours. I wanted to "recreate" this in starblast as a new challenge:
  - Try to survive as long as you can in this
  
  *NOTE*: You might crash your computer if you are not careful with the number of
  elements on your screen at the same time. Close the starblast window if your fps
  drops below 30, as it can be dangerous on your computer. (Honestly you won't
  last that long)
  
  Enjoy killing your starblast!
