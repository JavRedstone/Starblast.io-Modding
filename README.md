*User's Note*

Several folder paths can be seen. Each one leads to a different piece of source code, which categorizes into each of the different folder paths mentioned. For instance: the folder path, *./fun/* is primarily used for different things people can add to their mods to make them more interesting, or fun, whilst the folder path, *./tutorials/* is primarily used for different things people can see when they first start modding, and they need some help.

Have fun and enjoy your modding!
